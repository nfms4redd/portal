Symplyfied National Forest Monitoring System

This project implements a simplyfied version on the whole NFMS4REDD system.

It provides a Command Line utility for the manual generation of the stats using the Open Foris library, 
a chart generation system based on Velocity and a customized version of the Portal that is more or less the copy of that one 
present in the whole system.

Note that no Ingestion nor Pubblication mechanisms are present in this version. 
The System Administrator is also responsible for manually setup the data.
